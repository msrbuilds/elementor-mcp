## [1.2.3]

- Fix: Factory now strips `flex_wrap` and `_flex_size` from container settings — prevents AI agents from setting these values that cause layout overflow.
- Fix: Tool descriptions now include background color instructions (`background_background=classic`, `background_color=#hex`) so AI agents apply colors correctly.
- Improved: Stronger "NEVER set flex_wrap" guidance in build-page and add-container tool descriptions.

## [1.2.2]

- Fix: Row container children now use `content_width: full` with percentage widths (e.g. 25% for 4 columns) matching Elementor's native column layout pattern.
- Fix: Removed all `flex_wrap` and `_flex_size` auto-overrides from factory and build-page — Elementor defaults handle layout correctly.
- Improved: Tool descriptions updated with correct multi-column layout guidance.

## [1.2.1]

- Fix: Row containers now use `flex_wrap: wrap` instead of `nowrap` to prevent children from overflowing.
- Fix: `build-page` auto-sets percentage widths on row children (e.g. 50% for 2 columns, 33.33% for 3) instead of using `_flex_size: grow` which caused layout overflow.
- Improved: Tool descriptions updated with correct layout guidance for multi-column layouts.

## [1.1.1]

- Fix: Container flex layout — row children auto-grow with `_flex_size: grow` for equal distribution.
- Fix: Column containers auto-center content horizontally (`align_items: center`).
- Fix: Row containers auto-set `flex_wrap: nowrap` to prevent wrapping.
- Fix: `_flex_size` now correctly uses string value (`grow`) instead of array — prevents fatal error in Elementor CSS generator.
- Fix: `get-global-settings` input schema uses `stdClass` for empty properties to serialize as JSON `{}` instead of `[]`.
- New: Connection tab configs for Cursor, Windsurf, and Antigravity IDE clients.
